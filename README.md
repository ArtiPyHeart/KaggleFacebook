# My IPython notebooks for Kaggle's "Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?" competition

There are the notebooks I wrote to participate in the Kaggle's "Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?" competition.

I was finally ranked 32nd on the final ranking (private learderboard), and I could actually have been ranked 17th
if I had chosen another of my predictions as final submission... (That additionnal URL feature wasn't that useless afterall...)

You can also [read my blog post about this](http://www.thomas-robert.fr/en/kaggles-human-or-robot-competition-feedback).

If you want to run these, you will need to put CSV data files in this folder. I did not included them because they are 250 MB compressed. You can [get the data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/data).
