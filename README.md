# My IPython notebooks for Kaggle's "Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?" competition

There are the notebooks I wrote to participate in the Kaggle's "Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?" competition.

I was finally ranked 32nd on the final ranking (private learderboard), and I could actually have been ranked 17th
if I had chosen another of my predictions as final submission... (That additionnal URL feature wasn't that useless afterall...)
